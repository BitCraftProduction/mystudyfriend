We can see the full moon only once in a month.</div><div><br /></div><div><b>- New moon night or Amavasya</b>: When the moon is not visible from the Earth, that night is called as new moon night or Amavasya.</div><div><br /></div><div>- Due to very bright light of the sun, we cannot see stars, and other bright objects at night.</div><div><br /></div><div><b>- Celestial bodies</b>: All those objects that shine in the night sky including the sun, moon, stars and other objects are called celestial bodies.</div><div><br /></div><div><b>- Stars:</b>&nbsp;Those celestial bodies that have their own heat and light, are called stars. They are very big and hot, and made up of gases. The sun is also a star.</div><div><br /></div><div><b>- Constellations</b>: Various patterns formed by different groups of stars are called constellations. Some of them are <b>Ursa Major or Big Bear, and Saptarishi</b>&nbsp;(Seven sages).&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div><b>- Pole Star:</b>&nbsp;It's one of the brightest stars in the sky. It indicates the north direction, that's why, the Pole Star is also known as North Star.</div><div><br /></div><div><b>- Planets:</b>&nbsp;Those celestial bodies that do not have their own heat and light are called planets. The Earth is a planet and does not have its own heat and light.</div><div><br /></div><div><b>- The Solar System:</b>&nbsp;The sun, eight planets, satellites and other celestial bodies form the solar system.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div><b>- The Sun: </b>The sun is in the center of the solar system. It's the head of solar system. It's a star, so it is very big, made up of hot gases, and has its own light and heat. The sun is the ultimate source of light for the solar system, including Earth. It's about 150 million km away from us.</div><div><br /></div><div><b>- 8 Planets:</b>&nbsp;There are 8 planets in our solar system. They are Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune. Mercury is the nearest planet to the sun and Neptune is the furthest planet from the sun.</div><div><br /></div><div><b>- Orbits:</b>&nbsp;All planets move around the sun in fixed paths. These paths are called orbits.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div><b>- The Earth:</b>&nbsp;3rd nearest planet to the sun, and 5th largest planet. It's little flattened at the poles, that's why, its shape is known as a Geoid (which means an earth-like shape). The Earth is only planet that is favorable to support life. It's neither too hot nor too cold and has water and oxygen, which are very essential for life.</div><div><br /></div><div>The Earth contains water on the surface and appears blue from the outer space. Therefore, it's called a <b>blue planet</b>.</div><div><br /></div><div><b>- Satellite:</b>&nbsp;A celestial body that moves around a planet, is called satellite.</div><div><br /></div><div><b>- The Moon:</b>&nbsp;It's only one satellite of planet Earth. It's 3,84,400 km away from the Earth. The moon completes one revolution in about 27 days.&nbsp;</div><div>Only one side of the moon is visible, because it takes the same time (27 days) to complete one spin.</div><div><br /></div><div><b>- Asteroids: </b>Several tiny bodies which revolve around the sun, are called asteroids. They are found between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter.</div><div><br /></div><div><b>- Meteoroids:</b>&nbsp;Those are small pieces of rocks which move around the sun, sometimes they come near the earth, and drop upon it. They are called meteoroids. They are small in size, therefore, when they fall on the earth, they get completely burnt, and cause a flash of light.</div><div><br /></div><div><b>- Galaxy:</b>&nbsp;it's a huge system of billions of stars, planets, and clouds of dust. Our solar system is a part of galaxy. Our galaxy's name is <b>Milky Way</b>. It looks like a river of light flowing in the sky, thus it is named <b>Akash Ganga</b>.</div><div><br /></div><div><b>- Universe:</b>&nbsp;There are billions of galaxies, they form the <b>Universe.</b></div>
