Some of the best paintings are from Madhya Pradesh and southern Uttar Pradesh. These show wild animals, hunters, etc.</p><p><b>- Kurnool caves:</b>&nbsp;Archaeologists have found traces of ash here.

This began about 12,000 years ago. They cultivated wheat and barley as earliest plants, and sheep and goat as earliest domesticated animals.</p><p><b>- Burzahom (in present-day Kashmir):</b>&nbsp;Archaeologists have found traces of houses and huts at this site. They have also found cooking hearths inside and outside the huts.</p><p><b>- Mehrgarh:</b>&nbsp;Here, archaeologists have found one of the earliest villages.
